<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">Short Bio</h2>

  Currently, I am a tenure-track assistant professor at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (the Netherlands). Before that, I was a senior research associate at the [University of Oxford (UK)](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/jieying.chen/). I was a full-time IT (management) consultant at [Boston Consulting Group (Platinion) Nordics](https://www.bcg.com/nordics) from September 2022 to June 2023. From September 2019 to August 2022, I was a senior lecturer/postdoc at the University of Oslo (Norway). From March 2019 to August 2019, I was a research associate at The University of Manchester (UK) and worked on the EPSRC IAA Project "Comparison and Abstraction of SNOMED CT Ontologie together with Snomed International. 
  I was a PhD student at [Université Paris-Saclay (France)](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/). In June 2018, I was selected to attend French American Doctoral Exchange Seminar (FADEx) 2018 that organised by Mission pour la Science et la Technologie aux États-Unis. I received my master degree in the College of Computer Science, Jilin University (China). From October 2013 to March 2014, I was an exchange student in the master program of computational logic at TU Dresden (Germany) funded by the European programme Erasmus Mundus.

I am currently a Physics Ph.D. candidate at [Spin-Ion Technologies](https://www.spin-ion.com/) and [Université Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/), working under the mentorship of Dr. [Ravelosona dafiné](https://www.spin-ion.com/about-us/), the director of research [CNRS](https://www.cnrs.fr/fr) and CTO of [Spin-Ion Technologies](https://www.spin-ion.com/). My research involves magnetoelectric ("ME") materials for energy-efficient information technology and "ME" materials for data security in information technology using Multiferroics/Magneto-ionics/Surface charging, with a special focus on the boosting magneto-ionic effect using ion irradiation and implantation.
