  - title: "ConCur: Knowledge Base Construction and Curation"
    authors: "Partners: University of Oxford, Samsung"
    project_short: ConCur
    project: Concur is mainly funded by UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC). We study a range of semantic and machine learning techniques, and how to combine them to support knowledge graph construction and curation. As well as its application to knowledge graph construction and curation, the research will also contribute to the development of new neural-symbolic theories, paradigms and methods, such as deep semantic embedding for learning representations for expressive knowledge, and knowledge-guided learning for addressing sample shortage problems.
