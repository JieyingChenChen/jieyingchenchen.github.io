  - title: Anomalous Hall Effect Measurement System (AHEMS)
    authors: Song Chen
    project_short: Software
    project: The software is used to obatin the AHE hysteresis loops which is based on he relationship between the anomalous Hall conductivity and an external magnetic field applied to a material.
